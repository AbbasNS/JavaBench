implements the `Rule` interface and overrides the `validate` and `getDescription` methods. The `validate` method checks if the move is valid according to the knight's move rule. It does this by calculating the absolute differences in the x and y coordinates of the source and destination places, and then checking if these differences match the conditions for a valid knight move. If the move is valid, the method returns true; otherwise, it returns false. The `getDescription` method returns a string describing the rule.\n"}]}

The Archer can move in any direction (up, down, left, right) as long as there are no other pieces in its path. The `getAvailableMoves` method creates a list of all possible moves and then converts it to an array before returning.\n"}]}

extends the Piece class and overrides the getAvailableMoves method. The method checks all four directions (up, down, left, right) from the source place for any opponent pieces. If it finds an opponent piece, it then checks in the same direction for any vacant places. If it finds a vacant place, it adds a move to the list of available moves. The method finally returns an array of all available moves.\n"}]}

The `getAvailableMoves` method generates all possible moves for a knight piece given its current position. It does this by generating all possible moves (in the form of `Move` objects) for a knight piece, and then checking if each move is valid (i.e., it does not move off the board). If a move is valid, it is added to the list of available moves. The list of available moves is then returned as an array.\n"}]}

The `updateScore` method in the `JesonMor` class calculates the score based on the Manhattan distance between the source and destination places. The `movePiece` method in the `JesonMor` class moves a piece from the source place to the destination place. The `getWinner` method in the `JesonMor` class checks if the last piece moved is a knight and if it has reached the central place. If both conditions are met, the player who moved the knight is declared the winner.\n"}, {"name": "getWinner", "seq": 0, "prompt": "You are an AI programming assistant, utilizing the DeepSeek Coder model, developed by DeepSeek Company, and you only answer questions related to computer science.

The `validate` method checks if the source and destination of the move are within the boundaries of the game board. It does this by getting the size of the game board from the game's configuration, and then checking if the x and y coordinates of the source and destination places are within the range [0, size). If they are, the method returns true; otherwise, it returns false. The `getDescription` method returns a string describing the rule.\n"}]}
