to the rules of the Archer's movement, which is similar to the Cannon in Chinese Chess (Xiangqi). The Cannon moves by jumping over exactly one piece (of either color) along the file (column) or rank (row) to capture an opponent's piece or to move to a vacant spot. The Cannon cannot capture or move without jumping exactly one piece.\n\nHere's a complete implementation of the `Archer` class, including the `getAvailableMoves` method:\n\n```java\npackage assignment.piece;\n\nimport assignment.protocol.Game;\nimport assignment.protocol.Move;\nimport assignment.protocol.Piece;\nimport assignment.protocol.Place;\nimport assignment.protocol.Player;\n\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.List;\n\npublic class Archer extends Piece {\n    public Archer(Player player) {\n        super(player);\n        // Remove the UnsupportedOperationException if you plan to implement Archer\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public char getLabel() {\n        return 'A';\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public Move[] getAvailableMoves(Game game, Place source) {\n        List<Move> validMoves = new ArrayList<>();\n        int[][] directions = {{1, 0}, {-1, 0}, {0, 1}, {0, -1}}; // Down, Up, Right, Left\n\n        for (int[] direction : directions) {\n            boolean hasJumped = false;\n            int nextX = source.x() + direction[0];\n            int nextY = source.y() + direction[1];\n\n            while (nextX >= 0 && nextX < game.getConfiguration().getSize() && nextY >= 0 && nextY < game.getConfiguration().getSize()) {\n                Piece pieceAtNext = game.getPiece(nextX, nextY);\n\n                if (!hasJumped) {\n                    if (pieceAtNext != null) {\n                        hasJumped = true; // Found a piece to jump over\n                    }\n                } else { // After jumping\n                    if (pieceAtNext == null) {\n                        validMoves.add(new Move(source, new Place(nextX, nextY)));\n                    } else {\n                        // Can capture an opponent's piece\n                        if (!pieceAtNext.getPlayer().equals(this.getPlayer())) {\n                            validMoves.add(new Move(source, new Place(nextX, nextY)));\n                        }\n                        break; // Cannot move or capture beyond this point\n                    }\n                }\n\n                nextX += direction[0];\n                nextY += direction[1];\n            }\n        }\n\n        return validMoves.toArray(new Move[0]);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation follows the rules for the Archer's movement, iterating in all four cardinal directions (down, up, right, left) from the source position. It checks for the first piece encountered in each direction to jump over. After jumping over a piece, it adds all valid moves (either to a vacant spot or capturing an opponent's piece) until another piece is encountered or the edge of the board is reached."}]}

complete the `ConsolePlayer` class, we need to implement the `nextMove` method to allow the player to input a move through the console. This involves parsing the input string to extract the source and destination coordinates, converting them into the appropriate format, and ensuring the chosen move is valid based on the available moves provided. Here's the complete class with the `nextMove` method implemented:\n\n```java\npackage assignment.player;\n\nimport assignment.protocol.*;\n\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\n/**\n * The player that makes move according to user input from console.\n */\npublic class ConsolePlayer extends Player {\n    public ConsolePlayer(String name, Color color) {\n        super(name, color);\n    }\n\n    public ConsolePlayer(String name) {\n        this(name, Color.GREEN);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public Move nextMove(Game game, Move[] availableMoves) {\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n        Move chosenMove = null;\n\n        while (chosenMove == null) {\n            System.out.println(getName() + \", please enter your move (e.g., a1->b3): \");\n            String input = scanner.nextLine();\n            try {\n                // Parse input and convert to Move object\n                String[] parts = input.split(\"->\");\n                if (parts.length != 2) {\n                    throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Invalid move format.\");\n                }\n                Place source = parsePlace(parts[0]);\n                Place destination = parsePlace(parts[1]);\n                Move move = new Move(source, destination);\n\n                // Check if the move is available\n                boolean isValidMove = false;\n                for (Move availableMove : availableMoves) {\n                    if (availableMove.equals(move)) {\n                        isValidMove = true;\n                        chosenMove = move;\n                        break;\n                    }\n                }\n\n                if (!isValidMove) {\n                    System.out.println(\"Invalid move.

Please enter the move in the correct format (e.g., a1->b3).\");\n            }\n        }\n\n        return chosenMove;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Parses a string representing a place on the board into a Place object.\n     * The string format is expected to be in the form of \"a1\", where \"a\" represents the column (x-axis),\n     * and \"1\" represents the row (y-axis).\n     *\n     * @param placeStr the string representation of the place.\n     * @return a Place object representing the specified location on the board.\n     */\n    private Place parsePlace(String placeStr) {\n        int x = placeStr.charAt(0) - 'a';\n        int y = Integer.parseInt(placeStr.substring(1)) - 1;\n        return new Place(x, y);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation of the `ConsolePlayer` class allows the player to input moves in the console using the specified format (e.g., `a1->b3`). It parses the input, converts it into a `Move` object, and checks if the move is among the available moves. If the input is invalid or the move is not available, it prompts the user to enter a valid move again."}]}

If it is, an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown because it's not possible to select a move. If there are available moves, it uses an instance of `Random` to generate a random index within the bounds of the `availableMoves` array and returns the move at that index. This ensures that the `RandomPlayer` selects a move randomly from the available options."}]}

It includes the game loop in the `start()` method, where players take turns making moves until a winner is determined. The `getWinner()` method checks for a winning condition, which you might need to adjust based on the specific rules of your game. The `updateScore()` method updates the player's score based on the move made. The `movePiece()` method updates the game board after a move. Finally, the `getAvailableMoves()` method generates all valid moves for the current player. \n\nPlease note that this implementation assumes certain behaviors and rules for the game, which you might need to adjust according to your specific game rules and requirements."}, {"name": "getWinner", "seq": 0, "prompt": "You are a helpful java programmer that write the project based on the following

The `getWinner()` method checks for a winning condition, which you may need to adjust based on the specific rules of your game. The `updateScore()` method updates the player's score based on the distance of the move. The `movePiece()` method updates the game board after a move. Finally, the `getAvailableMoves()` method generates all valid moves for the current player.\n\nPlease note that this implementation assumes certain behaviors and rules for the JesonMor game, which you might need to adjust according to your specific assignment requirements."}]}
