If it encounters a piece of the opponent, it adds a move to the list and then stops checking in that direction. The method finally returns an array of all valid moves.\n"}]}

The `start()` method starts the game by iterating over the players and making each player make a move until a winner is determined. The `getWinner()` method checks if the last piece moved was a knight, and if so, returns the last player as the winner. The `updateScore()` method updates the score of a player by adding the Manhattan distance between the source and destination places of the last move to the player's current score. The `movePiece()` method moves a piece from the source place to the destination place on the game board. The `getAvailableMoves()` method gets all available moves for a player by iterating over all pieces on the game board and adding their available moves to a list.\n"}, {"name": "getWinner", "seq": 0, "prompt": "You are an AI programming assistant, utilizing the DeepSeek Coder model, developed by DeepSeek Company, and you only answer questions related to computer science.

It then checks if each of these places is within the boundaries of the game board. If it is, it creates a `Move` object with the source and destination places and adds it to the list of moves. Finally, it returns the list of moves as an array.\n"}]}

The `start` method starts the game, the `getWinner` method checks if a player has won, the `updateScore` method updates the score of a player, the `movePiece` method moves a piece on the board, and the `getAvailableMoves` method gets all available moves of a player. The `getNextPlayer` method is a helper method to get the next player in the turn.\n"}]}
