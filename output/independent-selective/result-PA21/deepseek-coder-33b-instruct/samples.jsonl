It uses the `getOffset` method of the `Direction` enum to get the offset for the move, and then uses the `offsetBy` method of the `Position` class to get the new position. It checks if the new position is valid and if there is an entity at the new position. If there is a mine at the new position, it returns a `Dead` move result. If there is a gem or extra life at the new position, it adds the position to the list of collected gems or extra lives. It then moves the player to the new position and returns a `Alive` move result. If the move is invalid, it returns an `Invalid` move result.\n\nThe `undoMove` method reverts the move by moving the player back to the original position and removing the entity at the new position. If the move was a `Dead` move, it removes the mine at the mine position.\n"}, {"name": "makeMove", "seq": 0, "prompt": "You are an AI programming assistant, utilizing the DeepSeek Coder model, developed by DeepSeek Company, and you only answer questions related to computer science.

It checks if the move is valid and if the player is alive after the move. If the player dies or the move is invalid, it returns an `Invalid` move result. If the player is alive, it returns an `Alive` move result with the positions of collected gems and extra lives. If the player dies, it returns a `Dead` move result with the position of the mine. The `undoMove` method reverts all changes made by a move.\n"}, {"name": "undoMove", "seq": 0, "prompt": "You are an AI programming assistant, utilizing the DeepSeek Coder model, developed by DeepSeek Company, and you only answer questions related to computer science.

It contains methods to get the number of rows, columns, and the player instance. It also contains methods to get a single cell, a row, a column, or an entity cell. The constructor of this class checks if there is a player and at least one gem on the board. If not, it throws an IllegalArgumentException. The getNumGems method counts the number of gems on the board.\n"}, {"name": "getCol", "seq": 0, "prompt": "You are an AI programming assistant, utilizing the DeepSeek Coder model, developed by DeepSeek Company, and you only answer questions related to computer science.

It contains methods to get the number of rows and columns, get a cell at a specific position, get the player instance, and get the number of gems still present in the game board. The constructor of this class also initializes the game board and checks if the provided cells are valid (i.e., there is exactly one player and at least one gem). If the cells are not valid, it throws an `IllegalArgumentException`.\n"}, {"name": "getCell", "seq": 1, "prompt": "You are an AI programming assistant, utilizing the DeepSeek Coder model, developed by DeepSeek Company, and you only answer questions related to computer science.

It contains methods to get the number of rows, columns, and the player instance. It also contains methods to get a single cell or a row or a column of cells. It also contains a method to get the number of gems still present in the game board. The constructor of this class initializes the game board and checks if the game board is valid. If the game board is not valid, it throws an IllegalArgumentException.\n"}, {"name": "getPlayer", "seq": 0, "prompt": "You are an AI programming assistant, utilizing the DeepSeek Coder model, developed by DeepSeek Company, and you only answer questions related to computer science.

It can be either a valid move (which can be alive or dead), or an invalid move. The `Valid` class has two subclasses: `Alive` and `Dead`, which represent a valid move where the player is still alive or a valid move where the player dies. The `Invalid` class represents an invalid move.\n"}, {"name": "MoveResult", "seq": 0, "prompt": "You are an AI programming assistant, utilizing the DeepSeek Coder model, developed by DeepSeek Company, and you only answer questions related to computer science.

It checks if the move is valid and if the player is still alive after the move. If the player dies or the move is invalid, the game board remains in the same state as before the move. If the player collects a gem or an extra life, these are added to the game board. If the player moves to a mine, the game ends.\n"}, {"name": "undoMove", "seq": 0, "prompt": "You are an AI programming assistant, utilizing the DeepSeek Coder model, developed by DeepSeek Company, and you only answer questions related to computer science.

It checks if the move is valid and if the player dies after the move. If the player dies, it returns a `MoveResult.Valid.Dead` object, otherwise it returns a `MoveResult.Valid.Alive` object. If the move is invalid, it returns a `MoveResult.Invalid` object. The `undoMove` method reverts the changes made by the `makeMove` method.\n"}, {"name": "undoMove", "seq": 0, "prompt": "You are an AI programming assistant, utilizing the DeepSeek Coder model, developed by DeepSeek Company, and you only answer questions related to computer science.

Then it sets the new entity as the owner of this cell. Finally, it returns the old entity that was in this cell.\n"}, {"name": "getEntity", "seq": 0, "prompt": "You are an AI programming assistant, utilizing the DeepSeek Coder model, developed by DeepSeek Company, and you only answer questions related to computer science.

It contains methods to get the number of rows and columns, get a single cell, get a row or column of cells, and get the player and the number of gems. It also contains a constructor that initializes the game board based on the provided cells. The constructor checks if there is exactly one player and at least one gem in the cells, and throws an IllegalArgumentException if these conditions are not met.\n"}, {"name": "getNumGems", "seq": 0, "prompt": "You are an AI programming assistant, utilizing the DeepSeek Coder model, developed by DeepSeek Company, and you only answer questions related to computer science.

It has methods to get the number of rows, columns, and the player instance, and to get a cell at a specific position. It also has methods to get a row or column of cells, and to get an entity cell at a specific position. The constructor of this class initializes the game board and checks if there is only one player and at least one gem in the cells. If not, it throws an IllegalArgumentException.\n"}, {"name": "getCol", "seq": 0, "prompt": "You are an AI programming assistant, utilizing the DeepSeek Coder model, developed by DeepSeek Company, and you only answer questions related to computer science.

It contains the number of rows and columns, a 2D array of cells, the player instance, and the number of gems. The constructor initializes these fields and checks if there is a player and at least one gem on the board. It also checks if all gems can be reached by the player. The methods provide access to the cells of the board and the player instance. The `isReachable` method is used to check if all gems can be reached by the player.\n"}, {"name": "getNumCols", "seq": 0, "prompt": "You are an AI programming assistant, utilizing the DeepSeek Coder model, developed by DeepSeek Company, and you only answer questions related to computer science.

It contains methods to get the number of rows and columns, get a cell at a specific position, get the player instance, and get the number of gems still present in the game board. The constructor of this class also checks if there is a player, gems, and if there are more than one player in the cells. If any of these conditions are not met, it throws an IllegalArgumentException.\n"}, {"name": "getNumGems", "seq": 0, "prompt": "You are an AI programming assistant, utilizing the DeepSeek Coder model, developed by DeepSeek Company, and you only answer questions related to computer science.

It has two subclasses: `Valid` and `Invalid`. The `Valid` class has two subclasses: `Alive` and `Dead`. This class is used to encapsulate the result of a player's move, which can be either valid (meaning the player can move to the new position) or invalid (meaning the player cannot move to the new position). If the move is valid, it can either result in the player being alive (meaning the player has not hit a mine) or dead (meaning the player has hit a mine).\n"}]}
