lives, and deaths. It also assumes that the `GameBoardController` class has methods to make and undo moves. The `MoveStack` class is used to keep track of the moves made by the player.\n\nThe `processMove` method first makes the move using the `GameBoardController`. If the move is valid and results in the player being alive, it increments the number of moves and pushes the move onto the move stack. If the move results in the player being dead, it decrements the number of lives and increments the number of deaths.\n\nThe `processUndo` method checks if there are any moves in the move stack. If there are, it pops the last move from the stack, undoes it using the `GameBoardController`, and returns `true`. If there are no moves in the stack, it returns `false`.\n"}

The `getEntity` method simply returns the `entity` field. The `toUnicodeChar` and `toASCIIChar` methods return the Unicode or ASCII character representation of the entity in this cell, or a dot if there is no entity.\n"}

Each subclass represents a different type of move result, including valid moves, invalid moves, and valid-but-dead moves. The `MoveResult` class is abstract and has two subclasses: `Valid` and `Invalid`. The `Valid` class has two subclasses: `Alive` and `Dead`. The `Alive` class has two fields: `collectedGems` and `collectedExtraLives`, which represent the positions of the gems and extra lives collected in the move. The `Dead` class has a field `minePosition`, which represents the position of the mine that the player died from. The `Invalid` class represents an invalid move, and has no additional fields.\n"}

The `MoveResult` class is an abstract class that has three subclasses: `Valid`, `Invalid`, and `Valid.Alive`, `Valid.Dead`. Each of these subclasses represents a different type of move result. The `Valid` class is an abstract class that has two subclasses: `Alive` and `Dead`. The `Alive` class represents a valid move that results in the player being alive and collecting gems and extra lives. The `Dead` class represents a valid move that results in the player being dead from hitting a mine. The `Invalid` class represents an invalid move, where the player's move immediately hits a wall or goes out of the game board bounds.\n"}
