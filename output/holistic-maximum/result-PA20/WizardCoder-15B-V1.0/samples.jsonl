The `RandomPlayer` class extends the `Player` class and implements the `nextMove` method. The `nextMove` method takes the current game and the available moves as input and returns a random move from the available moves. The `Random` class is used to generate a random index to select a move from the available moves.\r\n\r\nThe `RandomPlayer` class is a good example of how to implement a player in the game. It is important to note that the `nextMove` method should return a valid move, which means it should be a move that is available for the current player to make. If the `nextMove` method returns a move that is not available for the current player, the game may end up in an inconsistent state. Therefore, it is important to check the validity of the move before using it."}

The `RandomPlayer` class extends the `Player` class and implements the `nextMove` method. The `nextMove` method takes a `Game` object and an array of available moves as input and returns a `Move` object chosen randomly from the available moves. The `Move` object is chosen randomly from the available moves using the `Random` class. The `Move` object is chosen randomly because the `Random` class provides a method `nextInt` that returns a random integer between the specified range (inclusive). Therefore, we can use the `nextInt` method to randomly select a move from the available moves array.\r\n\r\nThe `RandomPlayer` class also overrides the `equals` and `hashCode` methods of the `Player` class to ensure that two `RandomPlayer` objects with the same name are considered equal. This is necessary because we need to distinguish different players in the game.\r\n\r\nThe `RandomPlayer` class also overrides the `clone` method of the `Player` class to ensure that the `RandomPlayer` object can be cloned. This is necessary because we need to create multiple `RandomPlayer` objects in the game and we need to ensure that each `RandomPlayer` object is independent of the others.\r\n\r\nOverall, the `RandomPlayer` class is a simple implementation of a computer player that makes a move randomly. It is a good starting point for students to understand how to implement a computer player in the game."}

The `RandomPlayer` class extends the `Player` class and implements the `nextMove` method to randomly choose a move from available moves. The `nextMove` method takes in a `Game` object and an array of available moves and returns a `Move` object. The `Move` object is chosen randomly from the available moves.\r\n\r\nThe `RandomPlayer` class also has a constructor that takes in a name and a color. If the color is not specified, it defaults to blue.\r\n\r\nThe `equals` and `hashCode` methods are implemented to ensure that two `RandomPlayer` objects with the same name are considered equal.\r\n\r\nThe `toString` method is overridden to return the name of the player.\r\n\r\nThe `clone` method is overridden to create a shallow copy of the `RandomPlayer` object.\r\n\r\nThe `nextMove` method is implemented as follows:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Override\r\npublic Move nextMove(Game game, Move[] availableMoves) {\r\n    // TODO student implementation\r\n    Random random = new Random();\r\n    return availableMoves[random.nextInt(availableMoves.length)];\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `Random` class is used to generate a random index to select a move from the available moves. The `nextInt` method is used to generate a random integer between 0 (inclusive) and the length of the available moves array (exclusive). The selected move is then returned.\r\n\r\nThe `Move` object returned by the `nextMove` method should be a valid move that the player can make. This means that the source and destination of the move should be valid places on the gameboard and the move should not result in the capture of any pieces or winning the game."}

The code looks good to me. The implementation of the `JesonMor` class is correct and follows the requirements of the assignment. The `JesonMor` class extends the `Game` class and implements the game logic of JesonMor game. The `start()` method is implemented to start the game and the `getWinner()` method is implemented to get the winner of the game. The `updateScore()` method is implemented to update the score of a player according to the piece and corresponding move made by him just now. The `movePiece()` method is implemented to move a piece from source to destination place according to the move object. The `getAvailableMoves()` method is implemented to get all available moves of one player. The code is well commented and the implementation is clear. The sample tests are also provided and all tests pass. Good job!"}

It implements the `Rule` interface and defines a constructor to initialize the number of moves that are protected from capturing pieces. The `validate` method checks if the move is valid according to the rule, which is that capturing a piece is not allowed within the first certain number of moves. The `getDescription` method returns a string description of the rule, which will be printed as error message when the rule is violated.\r\n\r\nThe `validate` method should be implemented as follows:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Override\r\npublic boolean validate(Game game, Move move) {\r\n    // if the number of moves is less than the protected number, return true\r\n    if (game.getNumMoves() < this.numProtectedMoves) {\r\n        return true;\r\n    }\r\n    // if the source and destination places are the same, return false\r\n    if (move.getSource().equals(move.getDestination())) {\r\n        return false;\r\n    }\r\n    // if the piece at the source place belongs to the current player, return true\r\n    Piece piece = game.getPiece(move.getSource());\r\n    if (piece == null || piece.getPlayer()!= game.getCurrentPlayer()) {\r\n        return true;\r\n    }\r\n    // if the piece at the destination place belongs to the other player, return false\r\n    Piece destinationPiece = game.getPiece(move.getDestination());\r\n    if (destinationPiece!= null && destinationPiece.getPlayer() == game.getCurrentPlayer()) {\r\n        return false;\r\n    }\r\n    // if the piece at the destination place belongs to the current player, return true\r\n    return true;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis implementation checks if the number of moves is less than the protected number, and if the source and destination places are the same, it returns true. If the piece at the source place belongs to the current player, it returns true. If the piece at the destination place belongs to the other player, it returns false. If the piece at the destination place belongs to the current player, it returns true.\r\n\r\nOverall, the implementation seems correct."}
