standard game. However, I can provide you with a basic example of how to implement a game of Chess using Java.\n\nHere's a simple example of how you might implement a game of Chess:\n\n```java\npackage assignment;\n\nimport assignment.piece.Knight;\nimport assignment.protocol.Color;\nimport assignment.protocol.Configuration;\nimport assignment.protocol.Game;\nimport assignment.protocol.Move;\nimport assignment.protocol.Piece;\nimport assignment.protocol.Place;\nimport assignment.protocol.Player;\n\npublic class Chess extends Game {\n    public Chess(Configuration configuration) {\n        super(configuration);\n    }\n\n    // Implement the start, getWinner, updateScore, movePiece, and getAvailableMoves methods here...\n\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\nThis is a very basic example and doesn't include all the methods you need to implement, but it should give you a starting point. You'll need to implement the `start()`, `getWinner()`, `updateScore()`, `movePiece()`, and `getAvailableMoves()` methods in the `Chess` class.\n\nFor each of these methods, you'll need to implement the logic according to the rules of the game. For example, in `getAvailableMoves()`, you'll need to return all the moves that the given piece can make, according to the rules of chess.\n\nYou'll also need to implement the `Knight` class, which extends `Piece`, and the `Player` classes. You'll also need to implement a `Main` class that creates a `Configuration` object and a `Chess` object, and starts the game.\n\nPlease note that implementing a game of Chess or any other game is a complex task that requires a deep understanding of game development and programming. If you're new to game development, I recommend starting with simpler projects and gradually working your way up to more complex games.\n"}
