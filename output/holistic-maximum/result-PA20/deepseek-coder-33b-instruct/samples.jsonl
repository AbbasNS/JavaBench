The Archer can move orthogonally in any direction, and can capture by jumping over a single piece of the opposite color. The method checks all four directions (up, down, left, right) from the source place, and adds a move to the list if the destination place is either empty or contains an opponent's piece. If the destination place contains a piece of the same player, it stops checking in that direction. The method finally returns an array of all valid moves.\n"}

The `start` method implements the game loop, where players take turns to make moves. The `getWinner` method checks if a player has won the game. The `updateScore` method updates a player's score based on the move they just made. The `movePiece` method moves a piece from one place to another on the gameboard. The `getAvailableMoves` method gets all available moves for a player.\n"}

The `start` method starts the game by letting the players take turns to move pieces. The `getWinner` method checks if the last move made by a player leads to a win. The `updateScore` method updates the score of a player according to the piece and corresponding move made by him just now. The `movePiece` method moves a piece from source to destination place according to the move object. The `getAvailableMoves` method gets all available moves of one player.\n"}

If the move is not orthogonal, the method returns false, indicating that the rule is violated.\n\nThe method then checks if there are any pieces in between the source and destination of the move. If there are, the method returns false, indicating that the rule is violated.\n\nFinally, the method checks if the destination of the move is occupied by a piece of the same player. If it is, the method returns false, indicating that the rule is violated. If none of these conditions are met, the method returns true, indicating that the rule is not violated.\n"}

If the number of moves made is equal to or greater than `numProtectedMoves`, the move is valid if it does not involve capturing a piece (i.e., the destination place is empty or the pieces belong to the same player). The `getDescription` method returns a string that describes the rule.\n"}
