It checks all four directions (up, down, left, right) and ensures that the Archer can only capture a piece if it jumps over exactly one piece.\n\nThe `checkDirection` method is a helper method that handles the logic for checking each direction. It keeps track of whether the Archer has jumped over a piece and adds valid moves to the list accordingly."}

If the input is invalid, the user is prompted to enter the move again."}

The `start` method handles the game loop, alternating between players and checking for a winner after each move. The `getWinner` method checks if the last move reached the central place, which determines the winner. The `updateScore` method calculates the Manhattan distance for each move and updates the player's score. The `movePiece` method updates the board by moving a piece from the source to the destination. Finally, the `getAvailableMoves` method collects all valid moves for the current player by iterating over their pieces on the board."}

This is checked by ensuring either the x-coordinates or the y-coordinates of the source and destination are the same.\n2. **Path Clearance**: The path between the source and destination must be clear of other pieces unless capturing. The number of pieces between the source and destination is counted, and the move is invalid if there are more than one piece in between. If there is exactly one piece in between, the destination must contain an opponent's piece for the move to be valid.\n3. **Capture Rule**: If there is one piece in between, the destination must contain an opponent's piece for the move to be valid.\n\nThis implementation ensures that the Archer's movement adheres to the rules similar to the cannon in Chinese chess."}

If not, the rule does not apply, and it returns `true`.\n2. **Move Validation**: It then checks if the move is a valid Knight move. A Knight moves in an \"L\" shape, which means it moves two squares in one direction and one square in a perpendicular direction.\n3. **Blocking Position**: The blocking position is calculated as the midpoint between the source and destination positions.\n4. **Blocking Piece Check**: Finally, it checks if there is a piece at the blocking position. If there is a piece, the move is invalid, and it returns `false`. If there is no blocking piece, the move is valid, and it returns `true`.\n\nThis implementation ensures that the Knight's move is blocked if there is a piece in the path, similar to the horse in Chinese chess."}

If there is a piece, the move is invalid as the knight is blocked.\n\nThis implementation ensures that the knight's move is blocked if there is a piece in the intermediate position, adhering to the described blocking rule."}
