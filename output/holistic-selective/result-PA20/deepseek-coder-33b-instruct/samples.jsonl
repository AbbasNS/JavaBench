list to store all possible moves. Then it checks all four directions (up, down, left, right) for valid moves. For each direction, it checks all places in that direction until it reaches a piece of the same player or a piece of the opponent. If it encounters an empty place, it adds a move to the list. If it encounters a piece of the same player, it breaks the loop because the Archer cannot jump over its own pieces. If it encounters a piece of the opponent, it adds a move to the list and breaks the loop because the Archer can capture the opponent's piece. Finally, it returns the list of moves as an array.\n"}

The `updateScore` method calculates the score based on the Manhattan distance between the source and destination places. The `movePiece` method moves a piece from the source place to the destination place.\n"}

The Archer can move in any direction (up, down, left, right) as long as it is not blocked by another piece of the same player. The method checks each direction separately and adds a move to the list if it is valid. The list is then converted to an array and returned.\n"}
