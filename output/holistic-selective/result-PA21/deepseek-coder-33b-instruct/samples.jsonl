The `Invalid` class represents an invalid move. Each class has a constructor that takes the new position of the player after the move and possibly additional information about the move.\n"}

It checks the type of the entity in the cell the player is moving to and handles the different cases accordingly.

If the player moves into an empty cell, it simply moves the player to the new cell.\n"}

The `Invalid` class represents an invalid move. Each class has a constructor that takes the new position of the player after the move and possibly additional information about the move.\n"}
