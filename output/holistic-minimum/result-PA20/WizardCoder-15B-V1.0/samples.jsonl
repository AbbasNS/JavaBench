The `getAvailableMoves()` method is implemented to return an array of valid moves for the Archer piece.\r\n\r\nThe `getAvailableMoves()` method first initializes an empty list of moves, and then calculates the direction and distance of the Archer's movement. The direction of the movement is determined by whether the Archer is on the left or right half of the board, and the distance of the movement is determined by the number of moves that the Archer can make before hitting a piece or going out of the board.\r\n\r\nThe `getAvailableMoves()` method then iterates through the distance of the movement, and for each distance, it calculates the target position of the Archer and checks if the target position is on the board. If the target position is not on the board, the method breaks out of the loop. If the target position is on the board, the method checks if there is a piece at the target position. If there is a piece at the target position, the method breaks out of the loop. If there is no piece at the target position, the method adds a move to the list of moves with the source and target positions.\r\n\r\nFinally, the method returns the list of moves as an array.\r\n\r\nNote that the `getAvailableMoves()` method does not check if the move is a valid move according to the rules of the game. This is because the rules of the game are not clearly defined, and it is not clear how to implement the rules of the game in a way that is consistent with the game's rules. Therefore, it is left to the student to implement the `getAvailableMoves()` method according to the rules of the game."}

method takes a `Game` object and a `Place` object as input, and returns an array of `Move` objects that are valid according to the current `Place` of the knight piece.\r\n\r\nThe method first initializes an empty list of moves, and then iterates through all possible directions that the knight can move. For each direction, it calculates the new position of the knight, and checks if the new position is within the gameboard and if there is no piece on the new position or if there is a piece on the new position but belongs to the other player. If both conditions are satisfied, a move is added to the list of available moves.\r\n\r\nFinally, the method returns the list of available moves as an array.\r\n\r\nNote that the `Move` class has a constructor that takes a source and a target `Place` object as input, and the `getAvailableMoves()` method returns an array of `Move` objects that have the same source as the input `Place` object. This is because the knight piece can move to any empty or enemy piece on the gameboard."}

The `ConsolePlayer` class extends the `Player` class and implements the `nextMove` method. The `nextMove` method takes a `Game` object and an array of available moves as input, and returns a `Move` object chosen by the player.\r\n\r\nThe implementation of the `nextMove` method is left to the student, but it should follow the rules described in the assignment description. The `ConsolePlayer` class should prompt the user to input a move in the console, and parse the input to create a `Move` object. The `Move` object should be validated to ensure it is valid according to the rules of the game.\r\n\r\nHere's an example implementation of the `nextMove` method:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Override\r\npublic Move nextMove(Game game, Move[] availableMoves) {\r\n    // TODO student implementation\r\n    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\r\n    System.out.println(\"Enter your move in the format of 'fromX,fromY->toX,toY':\");\r\n    String input = scanner.nextLine();\r\n    String[] parts = input.split(\"->\");\r\n    if (parts.length!= 2) {\r\n        System.out.println(\"Invalid input: \" + input);\r\n        return null;\r\n    }\r\n    String[] fromParts = parts[0].split(\",\");\r\n    String[] toParts = parts[1].split(\",\");\r\n    if (fromParts.length!= 2 || toParts.length!= 2) {\r\n        System.out.println(\"Invalid input: \" + input);\r\n        return null;\r\n    }\r\n    int fromX = fromParts[0].charAt(0) - 'a';\r\n    int fromY = Integer.parseInt(fromParts[0].substring(1)) - 1;\r\n    int toX = toParts[0].charAt(0) - 'a';\r\n    int toY = Integer.parseInt(toParts[0].substring(1)) - 1;\r\n    Place from = new Place(fromX, fromY);\r\n    Place to = new Place(toX, toY);\r\n    Move move = new Move(from, to);\r\n    if (!game.isLegalMove(move)) {\r\n        System.out.println(\"Invalid move: \" + move);\r\n        return null;\r\n    }\r\n    return move;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis implementation uses the `Scanner` class to read user input from the console. It prompts the user to enter a move in the format of \"fromX,fromY->toX,toY\", and then parses the input to create a `Move` object. The `Move` object is then validated to ensure it is valid according to the rules of the game. If the `Move` object is not valid, the method returns `null` to indicate an error. Otherwise, the `Move` object is returned as the chosen move.\r\n\r\nNote that this implementation assumes that the user inputs a valid move in the console. It does not handle invalid input or invalid moves. Students should add more error handling to the implementation to ensure that the program can handle invalid input and invalid moves."}

The class `JesonMor` extends the `Game` class and implements the game logic of JesonMor game. The class provides the following methods:\n\n- `start()`: Start the game. Players will take turns according to the order in `Configuration#getPlayers()` to make a move until a player wins.\n- `getWinner(Player lastPlayer, Piece lastPiece, Move lastMove)`: Get the winner of the game. If there is no winner yet, return null.\n- `updateScore(Player player, Piece piece, Move move)`: Update the score of a player according to the `Piece` and corresponding move made by him just now.\n- `movePiece(Move move)`: Make a move.\n- `getAvailableMoves(Player player)`: Get all available moves of one player.\n\nThe `start()` method is the entry point of the game. It initializes the game by setting the initial board, current player, and number of moves to zero. It then refreshes the gameboard printed in the console. It enters a loop where it asks each player to make a move and updates the gameboard accordingly. If a player wins, it returns the winner.\n\nThe `getWinner(Player lastPlayer, Piece lastPiece, Move lastMove)` method is called every time after a player makes a move and after `updateScore(Player player, Piece piece, Move move)` is called, in order to check whether any `Player` wins. If this method returns a player (the winner), then the game will exit with the winner. If this method returns null, next player will be asked to make a move.\n\nThe `updateScore(Player player, Piece piece, Move move)` method is called every time after a player makes a move, in order to update the corresponding score of this player. The score of a player is the cumulative score of each move he makes. The score of each move is calculated with the Manhattan distance between the source and destination `Place`.\n\nThe `movePiece(Move move)` method performs moving a `Piece` from source to destination `Place` according `Move` object. It modifies elements in `board` to implement moving a `Piece`. The `Move` object can be considered valid on present gameboard.\n\nThe `getAvailableMoves(Player player)` method is called when it is the `Player`'s turn to make a move. It iterates all `Piece`s belonging to the `Player` on board and obtains available moves of each of the `Piece`s through method `Piece#getAvailableMoves(Game, Place)` of each `Piece`. The `Move`s returned are valid on present gameboard.\n\nThe implementation of the methods is left to the student. The provided tests should be used to check the correctness of the implementation."}

The method first creates two `Player` objects, a `ConsolePlayer` and a `RandomPlayer`, and a `Configuration` object with these players and the given `size` and `numMovesProtection`. It then creates two `Knight` objects, one for each player, and adds them to the gameboard at the specified positions using the `addInitialPiece` method of the `Configuration` object. Finally, it returns a `JesonMor` object constructed with the `Configuration` object.\r\n\r\nNote that the `createGame` method is just an example of how to use the `Configuration` object to initialize the gameboard. Students should remove them and implement their own version of the method."}

It then checks whether the move is to a place with a distance of 1 or 2. If not, it returns false. It then checks whether the move is to a place with a distance of 1 or 2. If not, it returns false. Finally, it checks whether the move is to a place with a distance of 1 or 2. If not, it returns false. If all the checks pass, it returns true, which means the move is valid."}

The `validate` method takes two arguments: `game` and `move`. The `game` argument represents the current game state, and the `move` argument represents the move to be validated.\r\n\r\nThe first thing we need to check is whether the source of the move is an instance of `Archer`. If it is not, we simply return `true` to indicate that the move is valid.\r\n\r\nIf the source of the move is an instance of `Archer`, we need to check whether the move is valid according to the rule of moving of Archer. We first get the source, target, and player of the move. We also get the x and y coordinates of the source and target.\r\n\r\nWe then check whether the move is a single step or diagonal. If it is a single step, we check whether there is a piece of the opposite player along the path of the move. If there is, we return `true` to indicate that the move is valid. If there is not, we return `false` to indicate that the move is invalid.\r\n\r\nIf the move is diagonal, we check whether there is a piece of the opposite player along the path of the move. If there is, we return `true` to indicate that the move is valid. If there is not, we return `false` to indicate that the move is invalid.\r\n\r\nNote that we use the `Math.abs` method to calculate the absolute value of the difference between the x and y coordinates of the source and target. This is because we only need to check the orthogonally adjacent squares, and we don't care about the direction of the move."}

The method first retrieves the source and target pieces and places from the game, and the current player. It then checks if the target place is occupied by a piece belonging to the same player, or if it is occupied by a piece belonging to the opponent.
