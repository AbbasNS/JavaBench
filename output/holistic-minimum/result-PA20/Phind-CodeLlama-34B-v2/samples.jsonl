The `start` method is the main game loop, which continues until there is a winner. In each iteration, it gets the available moves for the current player, and then the player makes a move. After the move, the score of the player is updated, and the game board is refreshed. The winner is checked after each move.\n\nThe `getWinner` method checks if any player's score is greater than or equal to the score to win. If so, that player is the winner.\n\nThe `updateScore` method updates the score of a player according to the move he just made.\n\nThe `movePiece` method moves a piece from the source place to the destination place on the game board.\n\nThe `getAvailableMoves` method gets all available moves of a player by iterating all pieces on the game board and getting the available moves of each piece."}
