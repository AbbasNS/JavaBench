It includes methods for getting the current state of the game, moving entities, creating checkpoints, and undoing moves. The game state is represented by a map of positions to entities, a set of destination positions, and a stack of transitions. The transitions represent the changes in the game state, and are used to implement the undo functionality.\n"}
