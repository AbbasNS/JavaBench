The `StopCell` and `Wall` classes are also assumed to extend `Cell`.\n\nThis code also assumes that the `Cell` class has a method `isPassable()` that returns a boolean indicating whether the cell can be passed through by the player. The `Player` class has a method `move(PositionOffset offset)` that moves the player by the specified offset. The `Position` class has methods `getRow()` and `getCol()` that return the row and column of the position. The `PositionOffset` class has methods `getRowOffset()` and `getColOffset()` that return the row and column offsets.\n\nPlease note that this code does not handle the case where there are gems that cannot be reached by the player. This would require a more complex algorithm to determine whether a gem is reachable or not.\n"}

It includes classes for valid moves (`Valid`), valid-but-dead moves (`Dead`), and invalid moves (`Invalid`). Each subclass of `Valid` has a constructor that takes the new position, original position, and lists of collected gems and extra lives. The `Dead` subclass also takes the position of the mine that the player encounters. The `Invalid` subclass only takes the new position.\n"}

The setEntity method checks if the new entity is a Player before setting it, and the setPlayer method casts the result of setEntity to Player. The toUnicodeChar and toASCIIChar methods return the appropriate characters based on whether an entity is present in the cell.\n"}
