It provides two methods:\r\n\r\n- `makeMove(Direction direction)`: This method takes a `Direction` object as input and moves the player in that direction. It returns a `MoveResult` object indicating the result of the move.\r\n- `undoMove(MoveResult prevMove)`: This method takes a `MoveResult` object as input and undoes the move that was made. It reverts all changes made by that move.\r\n\r\nThe `makeMove(Direction direction)` method first gets the current player position and the cell at that position. It then checks if the cell is a `StopCell`, a `Mine`, an `ExtraLife`, an `EntityCell`, or a `Gem`. If it's a `StopCell`, the move is invalid and the method returns `MoveResult.INVALID_MOVE`. If it's a `Mine`, the player loses the game and the method returns `MoveResult.LOST_GAME`. If it's an `ExtraLife`, the player gains an extra life and the method returns `MoveResult.EXTRA_LIFE`. If it's an `EntityCell` or a `Gem`, the player enters the cell and the method returns `MoveResult.MOVED`. If it's any other cell, the player moves to that cell and the method returns `MoveResult.MOVED`.\r\n\r\nThe `undoMove(MoveResult prevMove)` method takes a `MoveResult` object as input and undoes the move that was made. If the move was `MoveResult.MOVED`, the method checks the cell that the player was previously on and calls the appropriate `onPlayerLeave()` method on that cell. If the move was `MoveResult.EXTRA_LIFE`, the method removes the extra life that was added. If the move was `MoveResult.LOST_GAME`, the method sets the `gameOver` flag to `false`. If the move was any other type of move, the method does nothing."}

The number of rows in the game board.\r\n- `numCols`: The number of columns in the game board.\r\n- `board`: A 2D array of cells representing the game board.\r\n- `player`: The player instance on this game board.\r\n\r\nThe constructor takes three parameters:\r\n\r\n- `numRows`: The number of rows in the game board.\r\n- `numCols`: The number of columns in the game board.\r\n- `cells`: A 2D array of cells representing the initial values of cells.\r\n\r\nThe constructor first checks if the size of the board matches the size of the cells array. It also checks if there is exactly one player in the board and at least one gem in the board. If any of these conditions are not met, an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown.\r\n\r\nThe constructor initializes the `numRows`, `numCols`, `board`, and `player` instance variables.\r\n\r\nThe `getRow` and `getCol` methods take a row or column index and return a 1D array of cells representing the row or column.\r\n\r\nThe `getCell` method takes a row and column index and returns the cell at that location.\r\n\r\nThe `getEntityCell` method takes a row and column index and returns the entity cell at that location. If the cell at that location is not an instance of `EntityCell`, an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown.\r\n\r\nThe `getNumRows` and `getNumCols` methods return the number of rows and columns in the game board, respectively.\r\n\r\nThe `getPlayer` method returns the player instance on this game board.\r\n\r\nThe `getNumGems` method returns the number of gems still present in the game board.\r\n\r\nThe `getReachableCells` method returns the positions of all the reachable cells from the player's current position.\r\n\r\nThe `getReachableCellsExcludingWalls` method returns the positions of all the reachable cells from the player's current position, excluding the cells that are blocked by walls.\r\n\r\nThe `getReachableCellsExcludingWallsAndStopCells` method returns the positions of all the reachable cells from the player's current position, excluding the cells that are blocked by walls or stop cells.\r\n\r\nThe `getReachableCellsExcludingWallsAndStopCellsAndEntities` method returns the positions of all the reachable cells from the player's current position, excluding the cells that are blocked by walls, stop cells, or other entities.\r\n\r\nThe `getReachableCellsExcludingWallsAndStopCellsAndEntitiesAndPlayer` method returns the positions of all the reachable cells from the player's current position, excluding the cells that are blocked by walls, stop cells, or other entities, or the player's current position.\r\n\r\nThe `getReachableCellsExcludingWallsAndStopCellsAndEntitiesAndPlayerAndNonReachable` method returns the positions of all the reachable cells from the player's current position, excluding the cells that are blocked by walls, stop cells, or other entities, or the player's current position, or the cells that are not reachable from the player's current position."}

The constructor also initializes the `player` instance variable.\r\n\r\nThe `getRow` and `getCol` methods simply return the corresponding row or column of the cells array.

It also has two inner classes, `Alive` and `Dead`, which represent the valid move where the player is still alive and the valid move where the player has died.\r\n\r\nThe `Alive` class has two fields, `collectedGems` and `collectedExtraLives`, which are lists of positions representing the location of gems and extra lives collected in the move. The `Dead` class has a field `minePosition`, which represents the position of the mine that the player encounters and dies from.\r\n\r\nThe `Invalid` class is a simple class that represents an invalid move. It has a single field `newPosition`, which represents the new position of the player after making the move."}

It has two fields `row` and `col` to represent the row and column number of the position, respectively. The constructor checks if the row and column numbers are non-negative, and throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if they are negative.\r\n\r\nThe class also has two methods `offsetBy` and `offsetByOrNull`. The `offsetBy` method creates a new instance of `Position` with the coordinates offset by the given amount. The `offsetByOrNull` method is similar, but returns `null` if the resulting position is out-of-bounds.\r\n\r\nThe `offsetBy` and `offsetByOrNull` methods both take two parameters: `dRow` and `dCol` for the number of rows and columns to offset by, respectively, and `offset` for the `PositionOffset` instance to offset this position by. The `offsetBy` method simply calls the `offsetBy` method of the `PositionOffset` instance.\r\n\r\nThe `offsetBy` method creates a new instance of `Position` with the coordinates offset by the given amount. The `offsetByOrNull` method first checks if the resulting position is out-of-bounds, and returns `null` if it is. Otherwise, it creates a new instance of `Position` with the coordinates offset by the given amount.\r\n\r\nThe class also has getter and setter methods for the `row` and `col` fields. These methods are used to access and modify the row and column numbers of the position, respectively."}

It has two integer fields `row` and `col` to represent the row and column number of the position. The constructor checks if the row and column numbers are non-negative, and throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if they are negative.\r\n\r\nThe class also has two methods `offsetBy` and `offsetByOrNull`. The `offsetBy` method creates a new instance of `Position` with the coordinates offset by the given amount. The `offsetByOrNull` method is similar, but returns `null` if the resulting position is out-of-bounds.\r\n\r\nThe `offsetBy` and `offsetByOrNull` methods both take two parameters: `dRow` and `dCol` for the number of rows and columns to offset by, respectively. They also take three additional parameters: `numRows` and `numCols` for the number of rows and columns of the game board. The `offsetBy` method simply adds the given amounts to the row and column numbers of the current position to create the new position. The `offsetByOrNull` method first calculates the new row and column numbers by adding the given amounts to the current row and column numbers. If the resulting position is out-of-bounds (either because either coordinate is negative or exceeds `numRows` or `numCols`), it returns `null`. Otherwise, it creates a new instance of `Position` with the new row and column numbers and returns it.\r\n\r\nThe class also has a `toString` method to return a string representation of the position in the format \"(row, col)\". The class also overrides the `equals` and `hashCode` methods to provide the necessary implementation for these methods."}

This is because only a player can occupy a stop cell.\r\n\r\nThe `setPlayer` method simply calls the `setEntity` method with the `Player` instance as the argument, and returns the previous player present in the cell.\r\n\r\nThe `toUnicodeChar` and `toASCIIChar` methods are overridden to return the Unicode and ASCII characters for the entity present in the cell, respectively. If no entity is present, they return a square character."}
